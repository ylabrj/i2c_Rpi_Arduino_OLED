    "# Raspberry Pi with I2C, Arduino and OLED display\n",
    "\n",
    "__Objective:__ Run Raspberry Pi (RPi) with two different Arduino boards and an OLED display, all communicating on the same two-wire I2C bus.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is i2c and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "[i2c is a relatively simple two-wire bus designed by Philips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) to interconnect mutiple microprocessors and components. \n",
    "\n",
    "> i2c terminology uses terms _master_ and _slave_. In deference to the [terminology controversy that pulled Guido out of his benevolent-dictator-for-life retirement](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/09/11/python_purges_master_and_slave_in_political_pogrom/), I will use the terms _primary_ and _secondary_.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's supported on Arduino and on many other devices like displays.\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment will have four devices interconnected using two wires form each device going to what is normally used as a power bus on the breadboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a big advantage over other connection types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  serial: requires a dedicated connection. And we only have one serial port on each Arduino.\n",
    "*  direct connection: a standard digital display require more than 10 wires.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voltage levels caution: Arduino (5V) and Raspberry Pi (3.3V)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the specs, i2c runs at 5V. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you plug in a 5V output from an Arduino to a 3.3V input on a RPi, you will probably damage your Rpi. __*But that's only if the Arduino pin is pushing 5V.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The reality of most 5V digital electronics is that it doesn't take a full 5V for a pin to register as HIGH (or logical 1). An Arduino will accept far less that 5V as a HIGH signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "On an I2C bus, either the primary or  a separate power source holds one of the two wires at the HIGH level. Flipping the signal to LOW (logical 0) is done by the primary or any secondary device \"pulling\" the level down to ground. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this isn't a short circuit, because whatever device is providing the HIGH signal has a _pull_up resistor_. It's there to limit the current flow. It's usually a high value - 10K ohms is not unusual. We don't need a lot of current since we're only delivering a signal, not powering something.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arduino and RPi pins both have built-in, optionally-enabled pull-up resistors.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have the RPi as master and the Arduino properly configured as secondaries, only the Rpi will be providing the pull-up-voltage - in this case, 3.3V. The i2c display also accepts 3.3V.\n",
    "\n",
    "> There's a great [tutorial here on pull-up resistors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if we make a mistake on our Arduino setup? Maybe we decide to test an Arduino i2c connection to the display with a sketch that makes the Arduino primary. If we forget to disconnect RPi from the i2c bus, it could be damaged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since I'm doing a lot of experimenting and I prefer not to keep wiring and unwiring things, I've configured everything with a *level controller* that handles connection of 3.3V to 5V pins.\n",
    "\n",
